# Review

This is a low-code app. Most interesting part of it is the screen designs.  The code itself appears generated by dhiwise.com and has a lot of boilerplate.  It's missing any data and much of it doesn't work. 

## Screen images

## Installation 

Needed to uncomment `platform :ios, '11.0'` in ios/Podfile to get system to run.

## Usage

* Lots of RenderFlex errors on various pages.
* Some buttons don't appear to work. 
* Appears to be a "low code" app built using <https://docs.dhiwise.com/docs/flutter/intro>, lots of boilerplate and some files without any contents.

    Logger.init(kReleaseMode ? LogMode.live : LogMode.debug);

  });
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return GetMaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      translations: AppLocalization(),
      locale: Get.deviceLocale, //for setting localization strings

      initialRoute: AppRoutes.initialRoute,
      getPages: AppRoutes.pages,
